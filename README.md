# miniflux
CSS file for my miniflux instance

Based on [ronilaukkarinen/miniflux-theme-midnight](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/miniflux-theme-midnight). I've updated to lead with SF Pro if you have it installed or rely on the system-ui / sans-serif. It also modifies the colors to accomodate both light and dark based on the system theme. The color theme is inspired by the [material expressive color generator](https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors).  

## To install
- Go to miniflux.css
- Copy the whole file and paste it in the css section under miniflux > settings
