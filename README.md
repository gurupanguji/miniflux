# miniflux
CSS file for my miniflux instance

Based on [ronilaukkarinen/miniflux-theme-midnight](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/miniflux-theme-midnight). I've updated to lead with SF Pro if you have it installed or rely on the system-ui / sans-serif. It also modifies the colors to accomodate both light and dark based on the system theme.
